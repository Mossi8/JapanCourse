### Task 1

# 2a: The microbial diversity could be used as a potential biomarker for the different types of
# ovarian cancer.

# 2b: The authors of the paper used DNA sequencing of the ribosomal RNA 16S to identify the different
# microbial communities in cervicovaginal microbiome.

# 3a: 1. What is the mechanism by which menopause leads to a difference in the microbial communities?
#     2. Would patients under hormone-replacementtreatments show a similar microbiota than control
#.       patients pre-menoupause? 
#.    3. Would the genotype of the patients could factor for the presence of certain microbial communities?

# 3b: Analyse more pateints on hormone-replacement theraoy.
